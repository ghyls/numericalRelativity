Numerical Relativity
====================


On this guide, we will cover the basic usage of every tool we have created.
They essentially consist of various scripts in C++, Fortran and Python, most of
them merged under an interfaced application built with PyQt5. 

Those files, and their basic usage are:

    **riem.py**: calculates symbolically any component of the Riemann tensor from
    any metric up to 4 dimensions

    **christ.py** calculates symbolically any Christoffel symbol, also from a
    metric up to 4D.

    **appFinal.py** written using PyQt5 libraries builds an interface for the
    two previous applications.

    **newtonMulti.py**: Computes, for a given number of cosmological objects, a
    2D simulation using a Newtonian potential (non-relativistic). It considers
    the changes in the mass and in the angular momentum in each collision, and
    builds the trajectory for all the particles using the potential created for
    the rest. Prints the result in a file called by default "data.txt"

    **einsteinMulti.cpp**: Does the same as *newtonMulti*, but an option is
    added to perform the calculations with Swartchild potential, instead of
    newton's one. It is also much more optimized in terms of performance.

    **mercury.py**: plots the trajectory of mercury around the Sun, using both a
    Newtonian potential and a version with a small relativistic correction. It
    uses only standard python libraries like *matplotlib*. 

    **simulFromData.py**: It reads the data written by newtonMulti.py or
    einsteinMulti.cpp and plots it in an efficient way, by using pyqtgraph.

    **plotGraphs.py**: It reads the data written by the Fortran scripts, splits
    it regarding to the timesteps and plots it making a simple animation.

In the following sections, we will cover the basic usage of these files, also
providing some examples and discussing some computational issues.
